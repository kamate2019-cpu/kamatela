# Verify payment: `verify_waffo_payment`

Read this whole file, in one go, before writing the function that confirms a payment. Copy its state handling as written: a simplified version loses payments or refunds twice. It contains, in order:

- **Rules**: ownership, the success rule, and what happens to expired, failed, late and refunded payments and to subscriptions. The example follows them.
- **`verify_waffo_payment`**: the complete `verify_waffo_payment/index.ts`, built on [setup.md](setup.md).

## Rules

- Accept `order_id` or `subscription_id`, load the row and check that it belongs to the caller. An order with a `user_id` accepts only its owner, also when guest checkout is enabled; an order without one is open only when `REQUIRE_LOGIN = false`, identified by the order id only the buyer's browser holds. Administrators may check any order (the admin orders page). It only reads Waffo and never opens a refund, so it is safe to call for any row at any time.
- Look the Waffo order up by the local id (`orderMerchantExternalId`) through the helper. Never accept a Waffo order id, payment id, amount or status from the client.
- One-time order: the payment succeeded ONLY when the Waffo order status is `completed`, it has a payment with status `succeeded`, AND the order `total.display` and `currency` equal the order row's amount and currency. Only then call `complete_waffo_order`; the order is paid only when it returns `true`.
- Keep the order `pending` while Waffo has no completed order for it and the checkout has not expired. Mark it `canceled` when the checkout expired with no payment under way, Waffo closed it, or every payment attempt on it failed. While a submitted payment is still on its way at Waffo, keep the order `pending` even after the checkout expired. A `canceled` order whose payment settles later is still completed when it is verified again, through the same amount and currency check.
- Return `checkoutUrl` only while Waffo has no order for the checkout and it has not expired. Once the buyer submitted a payment, opening the same page again does not continue that order.
- An order in `refund_pending` becomes `refunded` when Waffo reports the whole payment refunded, and returns to `completed` when the refund failed, was rejected or cancelled, or covered only part of the payment.
- Subscription (only when the app sells them): copy Waffo's status, `currentPeriodEnd` and `willRenew` onto the row. A pending subscription becomes active only with a succeeded first payment for the plan's currency and amount. A subscription the app holds as live that Waffo does not know (it was sold with another API key, for example a test key before the production key) becomes `canceled`. Without subscriptions, keep the subscription branch out of the function.
- There is no Webhook: this function is the only way payments, renewals, failed renewals and refunds reach the app. The pages call it as described in [checkout-pages.md](checkout-pages.md).
